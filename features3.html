    <div class="para" id="m1"><h4>MyNetDiary’s Foods Database vs. MyFitnessPal’s Food Database</h4><span>1</span></div>
    <div class="para"><h5>Database Size and Quality</h5></div>
    <div class="para"><p>MyFitnessPal is famous for its vast foods database, boasting over 11 million foods, (all data is as of 9/1/21). While it is, indeed, possible to find almost any food item in MyFitnessPal's database, this exponential quantity of products develops through crowdsourced, user-created entries. Anyone can add any food or dish to the database, resulting in many entries with incorrect or incomplete information and duplicated or out-of-date foods. MyNetDiary has over 1,215,000 professionally-entered and verified foods with accurate information on servings, providing excellent coverage of the US, Canada, UK, and Australia markets.</p></div>
    <div class="para"><p>MyNetDiary’s foods database is more reliable with all verified foods, and there are few duplicates in MyNetDiary. Before adding a new food item to the database, our data entry team checks that it does not already exist in the database so that no duplicates get accepted. In MyFitnessPal, crowdsourced entries result in many repeats and out-of-date/discontinued items and dishes, which can sabotage your efforts toward accurate calorie and nutrient counts.</p></div>
    <div class="para"><p>For example, if you search for “Frontega," which is a registered trademark of Panera Bread, meaning that there are only two foods in the world that can have this name—the whole and the half Frontega sandwich—you can find exactly these two items in MyNetDiary. In MyFitnessPal, if you search for “Frontega," you'll get several dozens of "Frontega" entry results, all with varying calories and nutrition information, ranging from 730 to 850 calories. Yes, MyFitnessPal has millions of foods, but can you find the right one among so many inaccurate entries?</p></div>

    </div>
    <div class="para"><h5>PhotoFood Service</h5></div>
    <div class="para"><p>If a food item is missing or not up-to-date in MyNetDiary, no problem. Users can scan the barcode of products and upload photos of food labels to the app, and the food will be added or updated in just a few hours by MyNetDiary. Dining in a restaurant? Send menu photos or the restaurant's URL, and MyNetDiary's team will add this restaurant to the foods database.</p></div>

    <div class="para"><h5>Tracking Nutrients</h5></div>
    <div class="para"><p>Finally, MyNetDiary has more detailed information about foods and nutrients. MyNetDiary tracks 51 nutrients, including all major vitamins and minerals, while MyFitnessPal tracks only 20 nutrients.</p></div>

    <div class="para" id="m2"><h4>Features Available in Free Tiers</h4><span>2</span></div>
    <div class="para"><p>As evidenced by numerous user reviews, MyNetDiary is one of the very few apps that provide for free all the features needed for healthy weight loss and maintenance.</p></div>
    <div class="para"><p>Moreover, MyNetDiary does not display any ads and does not track users. Users won't see ads for questionable weight-loss products and tempting foods displayed frequently in diet apps specifically targeted by ad networks.</p></div>
    <div class="para"><p>Also, MyNetDiary does not display incessant upgrade popups on every use of the app.</p></div>
    <div class="para"><p>Here is an incomplete list of features available in the free tier of MyNetDiary:</p></div>
    <div class="para"><p>The Premium tier provides more tools and more guidance with Premium diets and recipes, analysis, and feedback features. Still, all the basics, everything needed for healthy weight loss is included for free.</p></div>
    <div class="para"><p>MyNetDiary is the best free diet app for users on a budget.</p></div>

    <div class="para" id="m3"><h4>MyNetDiary’s Sleek Design</h4><span>3</span></div>
    <div class="para"><p>Colors, icons, food photos, and infographics make tracking fun with MyNetDiary. It's all subjective and a matter of taste, however, we often receive comments on how sleek the MyNetDiary’s user interface is, and how it’s a huge benefit of making the switch from MyFitnessPal or other apps.</p></div>
