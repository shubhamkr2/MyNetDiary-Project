I can send my husband our dinner and it makes it so he will actually log it. This app links with iOS health app to keep all your steps and it reports your water intake to your phone. Also links great with activity app for Apple Watch so I fell like it has a great sense of what I am doing. So many times I lost exactly how many ounces it predicted each day. It is as accurate and honest as you are!!!! Really love this app!!!!",
