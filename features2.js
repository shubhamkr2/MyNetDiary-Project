It’s like your waiting to see how *good* your choices are. Also being able to make 1 recipe and share it with others is such a great feature. I can send my husband our dinner and it makes it so he will actually log it. This app links with iOS health app to keep all your steps and it reports your water intake to your phone. Also links great with activity app for Apple Watch so I fell like it has a great sense of what I am doing. So many times I lost exactly how many ounces it predicted each day. It is as accurate and honest as you are!!!! Really love this app!!!!",

Update, I am on year 2 of the paid version. ❤️❤️❤️ My main motivation was being able to input my own recipes, which allows the app to calculate the calories in your serving.

I’m especially enjoying the food grades feature which is similar to that used in the Fooducate app, but doesn’t suggest a healthier alternative (maybe this is an area of potential growth in the app?).
